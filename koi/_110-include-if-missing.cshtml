  In this example, we'll assume your template needs <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap4</a> as the preferred CSS framework. But if it's used on any page, you may have one of the following situations: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap4 could already be included - so you shouldn't do anything</li>
  <li>A different CSS framework is included - so you should include Bootstrap4 automatically</li>
  <li>The current CSS framework can't be detected, so to be safe, you should include Bootstrap 4 as well, until the theme is updated to broadcast what it's using</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This page shows how to handle these problems with almost no code.
