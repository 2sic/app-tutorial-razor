# Razor Tutorials for .net CMSs

> This is a [2sxc](https://2sxc.org) App for [DNN ‚ò¢Ô∏è](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/) and [Oqtane üíß](https://www.oqtane.org/)

It contains around 500 snippets of code, which is executed when you look at it.
This guarantees that the code actually works.

You'll find a live, running copy of this tutorial on <https://go.2sxc.org/tut>.

You can also download the latest copy of this App directly from the [releases](./releases) and install it in a DNN with 2sxc, to play around with the code yourself.
