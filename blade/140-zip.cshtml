      <h2><em>RazorBlade</em> Text.Zip(...) <em>v1.1</em></h2>
      <p>
        These demos show how to Zip (clean/compress) text properly, because Razor Blade handles a lot of issues you'll usually have cleaning up text. Scenarios might be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-line text</li>
        <li>Cleane-up html, which may have more spaces and line-breaks than expected</li>
        <li>Just any text pasted from somewhere, which could even contain surprise white-space</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
