    <h2>Basic List Details using Code - with separate Details-File</h2>
    <p>
      Very often you have a list of items, and then a details-page showing just one item. In this example, we'll just use code to do this (so no visual query) - just so you understand the principle. This example splits the list/details templates into 3 files, which is easier to manage. File 1 choses what should happen, file 2 contains the list, and file 3 the details. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we'll look for the desired item in code, we'll use LINQ. To learn more about that, check out the @Sys.TutLink("LINQ Tutorials", "linq").
