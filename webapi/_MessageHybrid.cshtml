  <h5>Note about Hybrid WebAPIs</h5>
  These examples are all done to work in both Dnn ‚ò¢Ô∏è and Oqtane üíß. 
  Because of this, the Api Controller have special conditional statements like <code>@ifNetStandard</code> which uses different namespaces in .net core and .net Framework. 
  <br>
  If you only target Dnn <em>or</em> Oqtane, you can remove the lines you don't need.  
  See @hlp.TutLink("See how to use #" + "if", "hybrid410/page")
