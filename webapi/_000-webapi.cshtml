        Learn how to create and use <strong>WebApi</strong> to provide data to JavaScript SPA apps. 
      </p>

      <h2>Some notes before we start</h2>
      <p>
        WebApi is not directly razor, as it's not meant to actualy render HTML. It's coded using C# just like razor, 
        but won't have commands like <code>@@Html.Raw(...)</code>. Since it's the best way to communicate from the server with your JavaScript apps, we've included the basics in this tutorial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our examples use very trivial JavaScript code to call the API and show the results. Your SPA apps will usually be more sophisticated, but that would then be a topic for a JavaScript tutorial.
