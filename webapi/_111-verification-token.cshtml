<h2>More secure Basic WebApi Example</h2>
<p>
  In this example, we'll ensure that calls to your API only come from users who are visiting your website. This is to protect agains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" target="_blank">CSRF</a> attacks, where another website gets your users to interact with your API. That could be dangerous, because maybe your API has things only a logged in user should see - and without the CSRF protection, the other website could get access to that because the user is logged in.
