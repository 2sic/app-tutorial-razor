      <h2>Very basic WebApi Examples</h2>
      <p>
        In this example, we'll assume your WebApi controller is called <code>Orders</code> (so the file is called <code>OrdersController.cs</code> and has a class called <code>OrdersController</code>). It's located in <code>/api</code> which is the default location for WebApi controllers. <br>
        We'll show various usages of the http methods with the new <code>webApi.fetch(...)</code>
