  Tutorial Notes

  This file cannot be rendered in Oqtane, because it must inherit from Custom.Dnn.Razor12 - which doesn't exist of course ;)

<h2>Use Code-Behind in Razor Templates (new in V11, deprecated in v12)</h2>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>
    Code-Behind is being depraced in v12, because the idea behind it won't work in Oqtane ðŸ’§. <br>
    We'll continue to support it in Dnn and to use it, you'll have to inherit from <code>Custom.Dnn.Razor12</code>, 
    but we strongly suggest you move to the other features which provide the same functionality:
    <ol>
        @linker.TutorialLink("Reuse CreateInstance instead", 
    "reuse320",
    "CreateInstance is enhanced in 2sxc 10.01 to support .cs files to share code across Razor files and WebApi Controllers.",
    "")
    </ol>
  </p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    Razor Templates should be simple to edit for web designers. When you end up getting complex functions we recommend placing them in a Code-Behind file. This is different from shared code, since the code isn't shared. We're just splitting a razor file into the code-parts and design parts.
