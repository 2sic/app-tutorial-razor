<h2>Re-using Shared Razor Helpers</h2>
<p>
  Razor helpers are like functions that put HTML into the page. You can create them using the <code>@@helpers helpername() { ... } </code> syntax. What most people don't know: you can also share them, by placing them into a separate file. This lets you put a bunch of tiny helpers into a helpers-library and use them from elsewhere. To achieve this, we use <code>CreateInstance</code> to get an object with these methods, and then use it.

<p>The example takes a cshtml file using <code>CreateInstance(...)</code>and uses it as a central helpers library.</p>
